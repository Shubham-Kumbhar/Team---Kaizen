*Design Philosophy behind Meteor Crush*

We started off by creating a trello board for managing our work efficiently. Boards were split for art and programming tasks. 

***Programming Design - Unity (2021.3.16f1)
In programming, we used design logics such as Object Pooling, Instantiations, co-routines and different optimization techniques. 

***Audio Design - Open source tracks sourced from youtube.

***Design - We had envisioned adding features like an in-game shop where we can buy ships, and a nuke button which would charge based on 
		shots hit. The art was completed for the same, however merge conflicts resulted in this becoming out of scope, and we
		were not able to implement the same. We had also considered adding a boss fight

***Art - All art was created by Sankalp Jajodia and Nikhil Garg in Aseprite. This includes every single animation as well. No asset was 
	   sourced from the internet. 


**Scope**

Contrary to popular belief, meteor crush has quite an expandable scope, with elements such as boss fights, additional ships, extra powerups, boss battles etc. 
There is scope for multiplayer as well, as 2 players can go head to head in a race to score the highest, or even have a head to head battle wherein they have to take each other down.
